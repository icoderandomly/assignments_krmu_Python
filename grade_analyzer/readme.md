Roll No: 2501730400
Course: Programming for Problem Solving Using Python

Project Overview

Grade Analyzer is a Python-based mini-project that analyzes student marks, calculates total and percentage, assigns grades, and generates performance insights. It is simple, easy to understand, and focused on applying Python basics to a real-world scenario.

Objectives

Automate grade calculation

Analyze performance based on marks

Detect highest and lowest scoring subjects

Ensure input validation

Produce clean and meaningful output

Features

Calculates total marks and percentage

Assigns grades using predefined criteria

Highlights best and weakest subjects

Handles invalid inputs using try–except

Simple command-line interface

How It Works

User enters marks for each subject

Program validates input

Total and percentage are calculated

Grade is assigned based on percentage

Performance analysis is displayed

Python Concepts Used

Variables and data types

Lists and loops

If–else conditional statements

Functions

Exception handling

How to Run

Using Python directly:

python grade_analyzer.py


Using VS Code / PyCharm:

Open the folder

Run the script

Requires Python 3.8 or above.

Grade Criteria (Example)
90–100 : A  
80–89  : B  
70–79  : C  
60–69  : D  
<60    : F  

Sample Output
Total Marks: 430/500
Percentage: 86.0%
Grade: B
Highest Scoring Subject: Science
Lowest Scoring Subject: English
